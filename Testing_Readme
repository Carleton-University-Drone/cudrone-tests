Setup:
To run tests to need to create a configuration that uses the simulator as the build tool
Enable uart printing to window under Configuration:Simulator:Uart1IO
Under Configuration:building checkoff execute line after build and add the following line "mdb sim_instructions_mdb.txt"
Under Configuration:xc8 global:xc8 compiler define macro "DEBUG"

Running tests:
At this point, ensure you have the testing configuration selected and when you build the tests will automatically run
You would see All tests passed or _ of _ tests failed in the mess of console output

Adding more tests:
A test is a simple function that returns a boolean integer for fail or pass. Write your function, and ensure that it is
somewhere that it will only be build if DEBUG is defined. 
In tests.h add your function and message to the appropriate defines and increment the number of tests
If you need special external stimulus add and new process to the stimulus.scl
